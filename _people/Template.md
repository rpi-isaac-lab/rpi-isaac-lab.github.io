This is the template bio. This template has not led a tremendously interesting life. Hopefully you have something interesting to replace it with.

The section at the top has some important information for you to fill out. Some (like name) should be fairly straightforward. Image should be the filename of the image file in /assets/imgs (note that no filepath sould be given). Image circular can be set to "true" if you want it to make your image circular. Category should be one of ["PhD", "Masters", or "Undergrad"]. Status should be one of ["Current", "Former"]. Linkedin can be given you username, same with github and research_gate.
