I am a coterminal Mechanical Engineering Masters student with an interest in vehicle controls. I currently work with Rene running tests and helping with some of the result analysis for her research improving autonomous algorithms by bringing the human back into the loop. I have an undergrad dual in Mechanical Engineering and Design Innovation and Society, so I often spend time thinking about how humans interact with control systems. Outside of research I am an active runner, hiker, and Disney world fan. I also spend time teaching robotics to young children.Â  After graduation I am headed to work in Global Product Development at General Motors.
