# Brian Cooper

Hello, my name is Brian Cooper, I am 22 years old, and I am pursuing my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. I graduated in May 2024 from Western New England University with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a concentration in Mechatronics and a minor in Mathematics. I grew up in Upstate New York and my interests outside of school are bodybuilding, boxing, and frisbee.
