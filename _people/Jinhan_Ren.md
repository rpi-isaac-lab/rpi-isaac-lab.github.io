My primary research areas include the intelligent manufacturing of industrial robots, composite material manufacturing, wire-arc additive manufacturing, and the processing of sensor signals embedded manufacturing processes. I specialize in closed-loop control and sensing analysis. Additionally, I am keenly interested in smart home technology and possess extensive experience in robot programming, industrial robot applications, and machine learning.
