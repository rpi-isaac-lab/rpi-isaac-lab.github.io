# Alvin Chen

Alvin Chen is a fifth year PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He is affiliated with the Intelligent Structural Systems Laboratory (ISSL) and the Intelligent Systems, Automation and Control Laboratory (ISAaC) where he combines elements of non-destructive evaluation with advanced additive manufacturing processes to detect faults in-situ for metal AM. His current areas of interest are (metal) additive manufacturing and data-driven statistical fault detection. He holds a BS from Rutgers University in Mechanical Engineering.
