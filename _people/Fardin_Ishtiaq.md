# Fardin Ishtiaq

I am a 2nd year Ph.D. Student in Department of MANE. I did his Bachelor's in Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). My research interest includes energy optimization for buildings and developing robust control systems for that. The current project aims on developing a generalized intelligent RL agent that effectively use environmental resources to minimize energy consumption in buildings. My Hobbies are cricket and hiking, and of course fancy cuisines.
