# Rene Mai

I am a mechanical engineering PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. I am also a Pathways intern at NASAâ€™s Ames Research Center, where I work on the Digital Information Platform and the Human-Autonomy Teaming lab. For DIP, I work on algorithms and methods for fine-tuning large-language models for aviation. In the HAT lab, I am working on human modeling for future urban air mobility applications.

Although my research focuses on the most efficient methods for teams to accomplish goals, my professional path has been less direct. My undergraduate degree is in physics from Texas A&M University, and my juris doctor is from the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. Before RPI, I worked as a patent litigation attorney at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP. Through my work at both firms, I discovered my true love of learning and controls engineering, which led me to leave my legal career and start my PhD.
