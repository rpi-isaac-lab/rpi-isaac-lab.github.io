I previously worked on the CRC-3 quadcopter biplane tailsitter and am now starting to work with Prof. Mishra and Prof. Djeumou on modifying and controlling a Can-Am Maverick to at the limit of its grip. Aside from research, I spend most of my free-time reading physics books and building an EV car as a part of Rensselaer Motorsport, RPIâ€™s FSAE team.</p> </body></html>
