My research focuses on developing advanced guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) strategies for autonomous helicopter aerial refueling by integrating model-based control techniques with data-driven approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL). I am also keen on applying these methodologies to real-world unmanned aerial vehicles, particularly quadrotors. Additionally, I am working on creating an interactive optimization framework that incorporates a broader range of human knowledge into mixed-integer linear programming (MILPs). My core research interests revolve around control engineering and optimization. Outside of academia, I have a passion for flying machines and Formula 1 racing.</p> </body></html>
