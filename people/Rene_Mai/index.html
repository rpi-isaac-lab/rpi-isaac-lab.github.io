<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a mechanical engineering PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. I am also a Pathways intern at NASAâ€™s Ames Research Center, where I work on the Digital Information Platform and the Human-Autonomy Teaming lab. For DIP, I work on algorithms and methods for fine-tuning large-language models for aviation. In the HAT lab, I am working on human modeling for future urban air mobility applications.</p> <p>Although my research focuses on the most efficient methods for teams to accomplish goals, my professional path has been less direct. My undergraduate degree is in physics from Texas A&amp;M University, and my juris doctor is from the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. Before RPI, I worked as a patent litigation attorney at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP. Through my work at both firms, I discovered my true love of learning and controls engineering, which led me to leave my legal career and start my PhD.</p> </body></html>
