# ISAaC Lab Website

Public website for the lab!

This website is forked from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/), which itself is built on Jekyll pages. This allows for the majority of rotating content to be written in simple Markdown. Below, I will outline how students,projects,news updates, and publications can be added to and students may be retired from the site.

NOTE: I have not bothered to update the INSTALL.md and CUSTOMIZE.md files. These are original to the al-folio repo.
