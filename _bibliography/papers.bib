	abstract = {Fault detection techniques in metal additive manufacturing (AM) have explored a variety of monitoring methods to flag anomalies as they occur during the sintering process. Although many in-situ techniques are able to adeptly detect these abnormalities, several utilize machine learning black box methods that do not easily transfer to varying print geometries. An approach that is adaptable to a multitude of geometries holds an advantage in determining anomalies for more complex cross-sections and raster patterns. To address this lack of a geometry agnosticism, we propose a method that detects faults using the frequency content of the melt pool image response through an unsupervised approach. Scan line length and scan speed extracted from known geometry can be translated to associated frequencies via a spectrogram. We examine three specific geometries to determine detection performance on each by comparing the frequency content to the nominal response. A deviation from the expected performance will signify that an anomaly has occurred. We verify this approach is feasible for fault detection and is accurate in detecting anomalies that are hard to observe in the image time series. A feasible geometry agnostic method and the current interpretability will be discussed in this paper. The results reached in this paper strongly indicate that the approach is promising, has potential for improvement, and that a geometrically independent method is sensible. With further work, a generic algorithm applicable on any geometry will be achievable.},

	abstract = {Anomalies often occur in metal additive manufacturing from processing inconsistencies and uncertainty. A robust fault detection system that uses sensor measurements such as melt pool imaging has the potential to improve part quality and save production time by anticipating print failure. Toward this goal, we develop and validate a fault detection technique using melt pool geometry-related measurements from an in situ near-infrared optical camera. This method is unsupervised and is trained on a small dataset, mitigating human error in classifying fault types, and reducing lead times for preparing training datasets. Furthermore, this method uses learned geometry-informed nominal behavior of the melt pool signal to make informed decisions on the process health. There are spatial-temporal characteristics embedded in the melt pool images, caused by the periodicity in the geometry-dependent raster pattern. These characteristics can be captured in the frequency domain using the signal spectrogram, a representation of the frequency content over time. Defects will appear in the spectrogram, disrupting the healthy spectral response. To quantify healthy spectrograms, we use principal component (PC) decomposition to extract the features of these spectrograms as a set of nominal basis vectors. Anomaly detection is then performed by calculating the error between the original and reconstructed spectrogram vector by projection of the spectrogram PCs onto the nominal basis. The reconstruction error for anomalous signals is larger than that from healthy signals, which is then used for fault detection. A one-tailed statistical test is used to determine the fault detection threshold for the reconstruction error signal. This method is tested on three raster patterns and performs better than a comparative time-series thresholding method. We demonstrate that this time-frequency algorithm can detect both temporal faults (which occur at a single time instant) and spatial faults (such as those introduced by an improper sintering), differentiating them from nominal operation.},

	abstract = {With increasing adoption of metal additive manufacturing (AM) in manufacturing, detecting faults in the printing process has the potential to reduce waste from failed prints and streamline the production process. To increase robustness of anomaly detection, a statistical method of detecting faults from melt pool images is presented. This method uses parametric identification of 1D compression of melt pool images to build a nominal predictive model. Nominal melt pools result in residuals that are Gaussian white noise processes, whereas anomalous melt pools will not follow this distribution. Detection is performed through statistical comparison of incoming data with a nominal reference generated on sparse data. This approach successfully applies statistical time-series methods to detect anomalous melt pools in a metal AM process.},
