The ISAaC research group has broad interest in creating new modeling, identification, and control design strategies for a range of applications, including but not limited to advanced manufacturing, autonomous air vehicles, and intelligent buildings. We investigate fundamental control algorithm development as well as experimental demonstration of these in cutting edge applications.
