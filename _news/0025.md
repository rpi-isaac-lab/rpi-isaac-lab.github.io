In July 2019, Alex received ISA Educational Foundation Scholarship. International Society for Automation (ISA) awards this international scholarship to college or university students who demonstrate outstanding potential for long-range contribution to the fields of automation and control. He is one from only 10 graduate students (from Canada, France, etc.) who received this award in 2019. Well done Alex!
