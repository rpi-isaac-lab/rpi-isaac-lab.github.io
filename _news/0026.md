Alex gave an oral presentation of his research in IEEE 15th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) in Vancouver, BC, Canada on August 22-26. CASE is the flagship automation conference of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS). During “Data Analytics for Additive Manufacturing” session, he talked about the application of ILC to laser power input profile shaping in SLM. This work was perfomed in the first half of the 2019, and results will be published in IEEE CASE proceedings later this year.
