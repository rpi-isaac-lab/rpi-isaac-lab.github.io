The GEM National Consortium is an institution devoted to increasing the participation of underrepresented groups of people (African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanic Americans) in the pursuit of masterâ€™s and doctoral degrees in engineering and science. Each year, GEM identifies and recruits a select amount of undergraduate and graduate students who excel in areas of research and academic performance, and offers them fellowships in the hopes of supporting their career pursuits. The GEM Associate Fellowship is one such fellowship that is awarded to students by a GEM affiliated institution that provides the benefits of full-tuition and a yearly stipend in exchange for continued excellent performance. Well done Kristoff!
