Prof. Mishra has been granted tenure from RPI. He is now Associate Professor at the Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering department at RPI. As a tradition, the whole lab celebrates the news at the dinasaur BBQ in downtown Troy. Our labâ€™s alumni Dr. Jacopo has also come back from MIT. Congratulations Professor! The people sitting from the left to right are Yaser, Sina, Prof. Mishra, Yijie, Botao, Jacopo and Matt.
