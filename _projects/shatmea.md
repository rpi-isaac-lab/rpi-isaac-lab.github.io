How do humans interact with autonomous systems? Although mixed human-autonomy teams (“HATs”) outperform autonomy-only and human-only teams, particularly in uncertain or incompletely described tasks, we do not fully understand how humans react to and interact with autonomous teammates. Further, while autonomous teammate models can be produced a priori from first-principles physics and dynamical system modeling, human behavior is far more complex and far less understood. Thus, we seek to examine and understand how human behavior changes when humans work on a team with autonomous teammates, in the specific context of autonomous vehicles.
