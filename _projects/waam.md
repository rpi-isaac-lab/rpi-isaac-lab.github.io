For my research, I am currently working on Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing(WAAM). We have a very nice multiple-sensor fusion system integrated with robots and welders (Set up during the ARM project).

In the ARM project, I built a model based on input parameters and deposition performance of wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) and applied it to Scan-n-Print in-layer correction. I also implemented an acoustic analysis process into the WAAM process to identify the process defect and layer-by-layer height variation.
